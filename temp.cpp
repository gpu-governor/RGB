    - **Portal System (Multiple Types)**
      - **Red Portals**: These represent **"normal portals"** that teleport the player between locations (perhaps linked pairs).
      - **Blue & Green Portals**: These could represent **"special portals"** or linked portals, but work together to provide unique functionality.
      - **Yellow Time-Travel Portals**: These represent **checkpoint or time-travel portals** that allow players to rewind time to the last created portal, restoring progress at the cost of health or energy.

    - **Time-Travel Mechanic**:
      - The **yellow portal** (checkpoint portal) allows the player to **rewind time** to a previous state.
      - If the player dies without setting a yellow portal, they are given a **black death screen**, where they can create a yellow portal to return to their last saved point.
      - **Energy/Health Cost**: The yellow portal creation could drain energy or health, and there might be a **cooldown** or limited number of yellow portals the player can create in an area.

    - **Forced Checkpoint Creation After Death**:
      - If the player dies and has not set a yellow portal, they are forced to face a **black screen of death** where they can create the yellow portal to rewind time.
      - This encourages the player to **set portals in advance** and **plan ahead**.

    - **Portal System Usage**:
      - **Red portals** for basic teleportation.
      - **Green and Blue portals** that may have specific rules, interactions, or require cooperation between portals.
      - **Yellow portals** for creating checkpoints, with the risk of **energy or health drain** when used.

    - **Strategy**: Players need to consider **where to place portals** and **when to use them** in order to avoid having to use yellow time-travel portals too often, especially with the cost of using them.

    - **Visual Effects**: 
      - The **yellow portal** will glow and represent time manipulation, providing a visual cue that distinguishes it from other portals.
      - When the player dies, a **black death screen** could add an emotional layer to the playerâ€™s failure, and then the **yellow portal creation** could symbolize their second chance.

    - **Balance Considerations**:
      - **Energy or health cost** for creating the yellow portal to discourage overuse.
      - A **cooldown or limited number of uses** for each portal type to ensure the system is not abused.
      - **Dynamic interactions** with other portal types, where a red portal can be used to escape a difficult situation, but only **time-based portals** can allow for true "rewind."

    - **Game Progression**: The player will learn to use portals strategically, avoiding death by setting portals before difficult sections, and planning their routes to make the best use of the time-travel mechanic.
